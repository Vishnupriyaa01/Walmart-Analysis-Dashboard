                                    WALMART ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of Walmart’s weekly sales data from 45 different stores across various regions and understand 
store performance,holiday impact,dept wise sales and trends taht can help in better decision making.

Objective
The core objective of this comprehensive Walmart Sales Analysis Dashboard project is to conduct a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization of three years of historical
weekly sales data collected from 45 distinct store locations. By integrating various crucial external factors—specifically, macro-economic indicators like Fuel Price, the Consumer Price Index
(CPI), and the Unemployment Rate, alongside internal operational details such as specific Holiday weeks—the project aims to uncover the complex drivers influencing retail performance. 
This deeper understanding will allow us to identify clear seasonal patterns, measure the true financial impact of major holiday and quantify the correlation between the nation's economic
health and consumer purchasing behavior at a store level. Ultimately, the successful visualization of these relationships will provide Walmart's strategists and planners with the critical, 
evidence-based insights required to build highly accurate sales forecasting models, leading directly to the optimization of inventory levels, more efficient supply chain management,
smarter resource allocation for staffing, and the effective, timely planning of promotional campaigns to maximize revenue and profitability.

Conclusion
The analysis and dashboard confirm that external factors (holidays and economic indicators) are powerful drivers of weekly sales, outweighing simple time-series trends.
